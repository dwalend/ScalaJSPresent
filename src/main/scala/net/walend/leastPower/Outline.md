The Principle of Least Power in Long-Lived Projects

Examples from HMS Catalyst SHRINE

Not Quite "Why I Love Scala - Let Me Count the Ways"
Intro-Level, General Audience, and That's the Point
Most Examples in Scala


Odersky's 2016 Resolution
Li Haoyi's Blog


An Example - Visibility Scope

Use the Narrowest Scope Viable
Local Code Block if Possible
Method
Method Parameter
Private Class Variable
Broader Private Scope
Public


Sounds Like a Chapter in Gordon's _Elements of Strategy_
Which means I know how to do some analysis

Other Examples

Josh Bloch on Java
Doug Lea (and the old new guy) on Parallel Coding in Java
Pattern Book
Numberical Recipes in Fortran <strike> C
Javascript - The Good Parts
Python Example


What's Power?

What's a Principle?

Make a Principled Choice


An Example of a Historical Mistake

Coding for Parallel Systems
Single-threaded
Multiple Threads
Multiple Processes
But Often Multiple Threads is More Complex than Multiple Processes

Rewrite Coding For Parallel Systems (TODO Chapters from Doug Lea)

Pure Parallel
Immutable
FP
Scatter/Gather
Queues
Rondezvous
Transactional State
Shared, Mutable State
Distributed State

 
Immutability and FP
